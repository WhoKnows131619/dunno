          Assassin's cread Odyssey is the latest game in the action adventure
          series Assassin's creed and is set in ancient Greece trough the eyes
          of one out of two siblings, Kassandra and Alexios depending on the
          players choice. It being an open world game where the player can go
          anywhere from Sparta to Macedon it shows the everyday life of people
          in the ancient greek world.
        </p>

        <p>
        There are also many historical characters
          the player will interact with, of course they are not shown as they
          were in terms of personality, since that can't be told however they do
          have their real " profession " such as the philosopher Sokrates and
          the historian Herodotos. The main plot of the game is, as in many games
          fictional and revolves around a cult that controls the greek world from
          the shadows. In the end it's rather hard to say that the game has a
          specific message after all it is made entirely for entertainment.

        </p>

          The final person to take part in the story is the belgian nurse Ana
          who at the dawn of the war lives with her father in Paris, despite her
          fathers warnings she leaves home to apply as a nurse at Marne in order
          to help the wounded.
        </p>
        <P>
          In the end, this game tries to show the cruelty of war, the despair and
          grief that it brings, it rips families apart and sends innocents to die
          an often meaningless death. In that regard the game carries a very strong
          message to the players.
