Passchendaele is a Canadian war drama movie from 2008 focusing on a Canadian soldier during the third battle of Ypres. It reflects the brutality of the First World War through aspects like war / love hatred and misunderstanding, but it also shows that just because people stand on opposite sides they do not need to hate each other.
